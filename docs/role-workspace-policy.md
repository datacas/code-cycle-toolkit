# Role workspace policy

Every dispatched role has an explicit workspace contract. The contract is
enforced by `scripts/cycle.py` and `scripts/executors.py`; a caller cannot
upgrade a role's permission through dispatch arguments.

| Role | Policy | Repository mutation | Generated artifacts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `implement`, `resolve` | `workspace_write` | Allowed in the assigned workspace | Allowed |
| `review`, `rereview`, `security`, `bootstrap`, `coordinate` | `read_only` | Forbidden | Forbidden in the assigned workspace |
| `verify`, `run` | `disposable` | Forbidden in the source workspace | Allowed only in the disposable workspace |

`verify` and `run` must receive an `executors.DisposableWorkspace` and use its
`path` as `cwd`. The contract rejects a missing workspace, a mismatched `cwd`,
or a path that overlaps the source workspace. The caller creates and cleans up
that workspace; the dispatch layer does not silently create one in the
repository. The default auxiliary profile uses Codex because its sandbox can
confine writes to the disposable cwd; an adapter without that boundary is not
eligible for `disposable`, even when its process cwd is isolated.

An adapter is eligible only when it can enforce the requested policy. Codex
can enforce strict read-only execution directly and can confine writes to a
disposable cwd. Claude cannot enforce either boundary, so it is not a valid
target for `read_only` or `disposable` roles. Orca follows the same fail-closed
rule and requires its own explicit orchestration context where applicable.

This deliberately separates useful generated output from unauthorized source
tree changes: verification reports, caches, build output, and runtime state
belong in the disposable workspace and must not be used to justify granting a
write-capable role access to the implementer's tree.
